# MSR2022_dataset
This repo includes the dataset of an accepted papaer in MSR 2022 
titled A Deep Study of the Effects and Fixes of Server-Side Request Races in Web Applications. 
We collect applications generating raw-SQL statements, using ORM frameworks, or Node.js-based. 
We study the bugs from various aspects, including type of racing resources, root cause patterns, 
external effects exposed to users, internal effects on racing resources, unserializable patterns, 
and fix strategies. 
We expect that our results can help developers better understand request races and 
guide the design and development of tools for combating request races.
